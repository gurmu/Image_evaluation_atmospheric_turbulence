# Image_evaluation_atmospheric_turbulence

The project is considering face recognition at long range as impacted by atmospheric disturbance.Image evaluation with the impact of  atmospheric_turbulence.  In particular, we want you to evaluate the impact of atmospheric turbulence as described in the paper
